Hello, we're Kraken team from Monterrey, this is our proposal for AI Hackathon
which consists on reading data for improving finantial services for online users. 

The prediction trend allows whether user's income is greater than or less than 50 
thousand dollars per year
and take decision based on that information.

For example: Ana is am 18 year old high school, she's single, dependent own child of her
afro-american.

Now how does it work? 

***
We worked with tenssorflow to build or model and we deploy it in the machine learning engine of google cloud
we reached an acurracy of 82.48% with and average loss of .27 using the adult cesus dataset provided.

in tensorboard ill show you our arquitecture.

We used a combination of deep neural network and lineal regresion that are data clasiffier altgorithms

***

This is the form where Ana will provide her information.

Currently, the AI side is up and working, and the application is prepared to 
receive user's data through an online dashboard
where ads of different products and services  that might interest her will be displayed.
It is up to connect it with the UI and display those ads.

Thanks!
