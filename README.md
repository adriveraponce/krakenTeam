Hello, we're Kraken team from Monterrey, this is our proposal for AI Hackathon
which consists on reading data for improving finantial services for online users. 

The prediction trend allows whether user's income is greater than or less than 50 
thousand dollars per year
and take decision based on that information.

For example: Ana is am 18 year old high school, she's single, dependent own child of her
afro-american.

Now how does it work? 

***

This is the form where Ana will provide her information.

Currently, the AI side is up and working, and the application is prepared to 
receive user's data through an online dashboard
where ads of different products and services  that might interest her will be displayed.
It is up to connect it with the UI and display those ads.

Thanks!
